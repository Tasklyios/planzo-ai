Use these proven content strategies from top creators:

Key Elements:
1. Start with an unexpected statement or result
2. Create curiosity gaps that make viewers need to know more
3. Use personal experience or specific numbers to build credibility
4. Show behind-the-scenes or "hidden" information
5. Include pattern interrupts every 3-5 seconds
6. End with clear value and next steps

Content Style:
- Natural, conversational tone (like talking to a friend)
- Fast-paced with quick cuts
- Show, don't tell (use visuals to prove points)
- Create "wait, what?" moments
- Use analogies to explain complex topics
- Break the fourth wall occasionally

Hook Examples:
"Here's the one thing you actually need to know to blow up on instagram"
"Here's how much money I spend in a day as a 15 year old in school owning a 6 figure business"
"Is it possible to launch a tech startup and make money from it on day one?"

Format your response as a complete script with [VISUAL] tags for visual directions and [TEXT] tags for on-screen text.

Additional Context: ${additionalNotes || ''}`;
