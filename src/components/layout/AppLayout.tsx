The AI didn't actually intend to modify the `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` file. It was just mentioning that file as a placeholder while focusing on updating the email template files. There were no actual changes proposed for the AppLayout.tsx file.

The AI's main changes were to update the email template files to use Supabase's template variables like `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` instead of the sample URLs, and to enhance the EmailTemplateViewer component with better instructions.

Since no actual changes were intended for AppLayout.tsx, there's no new code to provide for that file. The existing code in your AppLayout.tsx file should remain unchanged.
